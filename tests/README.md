# Introduction

For more documentation about molecule testing, see ../molecule/README.md

This directory is the home of the test playbooks:

* prepare.yml => setting up a VM or container with the minimum requirements (that usually is there, but not always in a container)
* playbook.yml => running a test against a VM or container (default postgres version: 13)
