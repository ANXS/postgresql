# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL
# documentation for a complete description of this file.  A short
# synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# Default:
{% for connection in postgresql_pg_hba_default %}
# {{connection.comment}}
{{connection.type}}  {{connection.database}}  {{connection.user}}  {{connection.address}}  {{connection.method}}
{% endfor %}

# Password hosts
{% for host in postgresql_pg_hba_passwd_hosts %}
host  all  all  {{host}}  password
{% endfor %}

# Trusted hosts
{% for host in postgresql_pg_hba_trust_hosts %}
host  all  all  {{host}}  trust
{% endfor %}

# Replication hosts
{% for host in postgresql_pg_hba_replication_hosts %}
host replication {{postgresql_replication_user}} {{hostvars[host]['ansible_' + postgresql_replication_interface]['ipv4']['address']}}/32 {{postgresql_replication_auth_method}}
{% endfor %}
{% for address in postgresql_pg_hba_replication_addresses %}
host replication {{postgresql_replication_user}} {{address}} {{postgresql_replication_auth_method}}
{% endfor %}

# User custom
{% for connection in postgresql_pg_hba_custom %}
# {{connection.comment}}
{{connection.type}}  {{connection.database}}  {{connection.user}}  {{connection.address}}  {{connection.method}}
{% endfor %}
